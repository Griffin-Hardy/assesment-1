// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const AnalysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which develpoers obtain all pertinent information regarding the project from the client. "

const Design = "This is the third step, in which developers will determin the overall look of the site (colors, layout, font, images, etc..) and plan out how they can achieve that."

const Implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which developers build the code for the site, using html, javascript, and css, to implemnt the design they came up with."

const TestingAndIntegration = "This is the fith step, in which developers will test the functionality of their code and assure it is working as intended, making sure any bugs are fixed, and the itegration of each individule developers code works."

const Maintain = "This is the sixth and final step, in which developers keep their project up to date and running smoothly as well as performing optimally."
